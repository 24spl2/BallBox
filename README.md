# BallBox
Colorful Balls Jumping Everywhere in a Box!

Didn't you want to know what it looked like to have 12 balls floating in a box? what about 2000? You can never imagine such glory. Therefore it must be made.


With Graphics basics (and some fake physics), I used basic draw functions to draw these balls (which can turn into lines or triangles!). Positions and velocities are kept in two different vectors and are updated every frame.
